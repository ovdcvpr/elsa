DryDocs: DRY Documentation; define a doc somewhere and then script automatically writes to files
I added to my TODO another feature in the same spirit as the DryDocs.
With DryDoc, we have one single file where the documentation for many methods spread throughout the project can be found,
and magicpandas will automatically update the documentations to the implementations. Similarly, we have various
configuration properties spread throughout all the classes within the project. We can have a script that aggregates
these properties into one single JSON file, which can be logged, or modified and automatically distributed back
to the implementations.

magicpandas config --push ...
magicpandas config --pull ...




# todo: during drydocs, include a preview of the dataframe
